# How do I solve a problem?

What is a Business? A Business solves a problem.

When you apply for a job what is it that the employer is looking for?
	Someone who's the best fit to solve a problem in their company.
	YOU are selling YOUR skillset to solve a problem whenever you take a job.
	So if you think about your ability to provide value or even help someone, it changes everything.

**Most degree means absolutely nothing without the ability to first understand what people want, which is how to solve problems.**

YOU WILL NEVER BECOME JOBLESS IF YOU CAN ACTUALLY SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE HAVE.
	The better you can do can do that, the more successful you as a business become.

### What problems should you solve if you don't know anything yet isn't that why you go to school?

### **More Than Half of College Graduates Are Working Highschool Level Jobs**

School is like this little bubble where you learn:
* How to take tests 
* How to show up for attendance
* How to do meaningless busy work
When you're building a business, people don't care if you ditch your homework. They just want you to solve the problem they have.

That is why spending at least 1 hour of your free time solving a problem that you actually have. Start by yourself & then continue to other.

That is why the best business you can start is the smartest business that you can start as a student and unlike traditional business that require huge upfront investments: an education business that can scale infinitely you can help one person or 1 million people with basically the same effort.

## The Problem you can solve doesn't need to be groundbreaking at first.

Even the biggest companies in the world started with a simple problem to fix, like Amazon started as just selling books online.

# What does it actually take to start a business?
1. **Problem to solve**
2. **Way to accept Payment**
3. **Customer to sell**
	   The hardest & difficult thing to tackle when starting a business. But you can actually take advantage of your position as a student. They're younger versions of yourself that experience the same issues that you have previously.
	   
	   Start posting on youtube. It's the second largest search engine in the world. Educaion content is actually what the algorithm is encouraging right now.

When starting an educational YouTube Video: It's not about the production quality.
It all centers upon how well you can solve a problem & how you can articulate that solution clearly.

You're gonna end up learning anyway. So why not documenting the process and help others along the way.
